I received my master degree in computer science at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/), China. I visited [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/) as an exchange student in 2016, and received my BS degree in electronic information engineering from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm), China, in 2017. I am now working towards my doctor degree in the Distributed System group at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/). My research is mainly focused in the area of attacks and defences in federated learning systems.
